# Non-Donor Selection Bounds Configuration
#
# This config defines the 5-scenario sensitivity grid for analyzing
# selection bias from non-donor physicians.
#
# Each scenario makes different assumptions about non-donor ideology,
# allowing us to compute implied population means under various conditions.

scenarios:
  S1_same_as_donors:
    name: "Same as donors"
    description: "Non-donors have same average ideology as donors"
    mu_non_formula: "mu_donor"  # mu_non = mu_donor

  S2_neutral:
    name: "Neutral"
    description: "Non-donors are ideologically neutral (centered at 0)"
    mu_non_formula: "0"  # mu_non = 0

  S3_moderated:
    name: "Moderated toward center"
    description: "Non-donors are halfway between donors and neutral"
    mu_non_formula: "0.5 * mu_donor"  # mu_non = 0.5 * mu_donor

  S4_opposite:
    name: "Opposite"
    description: "Non-donors have opposite ideology from donors"
    mu_non_formula: "-mu_donor"  # mu_non = -mu_donor

  S5_slightly_opposite:
    name: "Slightly opposite"
    description: "Non-donors lean slightly opposite from donors"
    mu_non_formula: "-0.5 * mu_donor"  # mu_non = -0.5 * mu_donor

# Donor participation rate sources
# These are the different ways to estimate the share of physicians who donate
participation_rate_sources:
  nppes:
    name: "NPPES denominator"
    description: "Donors divided by total NPPES physicians"
    priority: 1

  ahrf:
    name: "AHRF denominator"
    description: "Donors divided by AHRF state physician totals"
    priority: 2

  observed:
    name: "Observed linkage rate"
    description: "Donor share among successfully linked physicians"
    priority: 3

# Notes:
# - mu_donor is the observed mean ideology among physician donors
# - mu_non is the assumed mean ideology among non-donor physicians
# - mu_all = p * mu_donor + (1-p) * mu_non, where p is participation rate
#
# Interpretation:
# - S1 (same): Selection is random, donors represent all physicians
# - S2 (neutral): Non-donors are apolitical, donors are a biased sample
# - S3 (moderated): Non-donors are less polarized than donors
# - S4 (opposite): Extreme selection bias, donors are opposite of population
# - S5 (slightly opposite): Moderate selection bias in opposite direction
#
# The range from S1 to S4/S5 provides bounds on possible population means.
